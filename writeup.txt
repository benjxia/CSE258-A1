Feature engineering: Used the mean values for compensation and early access, some people might only play games they got for free.
Used latent dirichlet allocation topic modeling to represent each game as a vector of topics based on the review text.

Used the rankFM package for played prediction - tried to implement this from scratch with BPR loss - it worked - but it converged slowly so I
switched to rankFM for its WARP loss.

Recycled my factorization machine from played prediction (that converged slowly) and adapted it for hours prediction, same features, nothing special.

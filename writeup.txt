Feature engineering: Used the mean values for compensation and early access, some people might only play games they got for free.
Used latent dirichlet allocation topic modeling to represent each game as a vector of topics based on the review text.

Used the rankFM package for played prediction - tried to implement this from scratch with BPR loss - it worked - but it converged slowly so I
switched to rankFM for its WARP loss. Then fed into logistic regression w/ rankFM score and popularity for final predictions.
Predict 1 for each user if score is >= each user's median score.

Used same features as above with a fastFM for time played (after a lot of hyperparameter tuning).

Hyperparameter tuning done with 20-fold cross validation on train.json.gz

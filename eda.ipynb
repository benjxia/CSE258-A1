       "'The bard... He\\'s a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Selfish, egoistic, zynic, mostly interested in cleavage, maybe also beer. The game pulls out an incredible amount of humour. And combat goes alot about summoning creatures. Pros:\\n+ funny (!!)\\n+ voice acting\\n+ songs\\n+ RPG classic\\nCons:\\n- buggy (!!!) Linux users read below\\n- outdated visuals\\nI finished it on Windows many many years ago and, hell, it was fun! It\\'s sad whoever did the job of porting it to Linux didn\\'t put much effort into it.\\nInterface often doesn\\'t listen, in-game map stops following player\\'s direction after 360 turn, support for generic controller (anything but xbox360) is only partial (and can\\'t remap), abusive particle system sometimes renders game unplayable (if unlucky, one torch on the map will freeze the game entirely). ...and thus ends the Bard\\'s Tale.  This was a GREAT hidden gem, which I think a friend sent me.  In anycase it\\'s been sitting in my game library for awhile so decided to play it.  It\\'s a top down diablo adventure style game.  The game is decent and challenging and perhaps the only thing I didn\\'t like about it was the top down view, it just took awhile to get use to.  The storyline and game play is very close to a Monty Python, Princess Bride, and Robin Hood Men in Tights.  It\\'s just full of great derp.  The narrator, by Tony Jay brought the game to life.  The voice acting was wonderful and it was hard to put down.\\nJust like Bard\\'s that spin up a great story, The Bard\\'s Tale tells a great story and it was really enjoyable..  I recommend it to anyone that needs a good smile brought to their face. An ammusing narative, but it can get old quick when that\\'s all to save you from dodgy combat mechanics that result in you getting one shot at the same point every time, miles from a save point.\\nIt\\'s a one-playthrough wonder, something to not be taken too seriously, and not too heavily invested in. The creators of The Bard\\'s Tale (2004) said that they wanted to create something special and that\\'s exactly what The Bard\\'s Tale is. The game is something of a fractured fairy-tale and focuses more on poking fun at the fantasy/adventure/rpg genre than creating just another entry in the sea of fantasy rpgs. You play as The Bard (voiced by Cary Elwes) who is more interested in women, wine, and coin than adventuring. He uses his magic for his own personal gain. Being pulled into an adventure to save a damsel in distress and stop an evil sorcerer was the last thing on his mind. So of course... that\\'s what happens. And so our story begins... The game serves more as a vessel for crude humor, snarky remarks, and breaking the 4th wall. This may not be for everybody but certain lines are bound to make you chuckle. As for the gameplay, it\\'s not bad at all. The game is solid, simple, and different from most fantasy games. Rather than having convoluted tech trees and a long list of abilities, The Bard\\'s Tale focuses on simple top-down combat and using summons. My main complaint is the repetitiveness of the combat. Some segments felt like they were there to pad the game time and give you more experience but gaining new summons and the occasional weapon upgrade help to keep things a bit more fresh. Overall, I had a lot of fun playing this game and enjoying some sharp wit and silly songs while exploring a unique Scottish fantasy setting.\\nFor those who are fans of the original games, the original Bard\\'s Tale trilogy from the 80s now comes with this game. I haven\\'t played them but I\\'ve heard that The Bard\\'s Tale (2004) hardly resembles the original games. With 4 games in 1, this may be enough to hold you until the release of the newly kickstarted The Bard\\'s Tale IV.\\n7/10 A fun little romp in nostalgia, The Bard\\'s Tale is a Diablo-esque action RPG that, instead of demons and a dark atmosphere, takes place in a relatively pleasant land where humor abounds.  As you venture through the game you\\'ll encounter all manner of singing goblins, hilarious misunderstandings, and of course, your own personal bard who doesn\\'t so much want to adventure as get laid.\\nPlaying as an all around shady individual in a hilarious atmosphere is good fun but the majority of the mechanics in the game are noticably dated at this point.  I recommend the game for those who enjoy humorous stories that don\\'t take themselves too seriously and for those who had a blast in old-school action RPGs (Baldur\\'s Gate or Champions of Norrath on consoles come to mind).  I do not recommend it for people looking for anything groundbreaking in today\\'s era or those looking for a game with complex mechanics.\\nA good game as long as you go into it expecting it to be what it is and not something more. This game does not port well to PC. I never played it on the console, but I can\\'t believe that it was as buggy as the PC. There are very few games I play through more than once.   There are even fewer RPGs.  This is one of them.  With the amazing vocal talents, excellent music, laugh-out-loud funny comments, asides, and conversations, this game will forever give me a smile.\\nAs with the majority of RPGs, you\\'re a low-level schmo who gets \\'invited\\' to partake on an ever-expanding adventure where you ascend the level tree, getting bigger weapons, fighting bigger monsters, and eventually get the girl, and live happily ever after.  Except in this case, the game shows that things aren\\'t quite peachy, and seem to go downhill, rather than up.\\nThe game shows you the wonderful side-effects of your murderous misanthropy, as you gaily stab, shoot and zap your way across a beautiful scottish and norse-themed fantasy land... Whether you follow the plot, or try to deviate from it, the wonderful writing keeps you amused, and on your toes, guiding you in the right direction at all times.\\nThere\\'s a LOT in this game, although it sometimes doesn\\'t feel that way.   The level-grinders will find a lot to keep them amused, the magic-lovers, the archers, the swordsmen, will all find that the balance is quite nice (although I think the bow may be slightly under-powered compared to the sword, but only by a fraction, and the ability to sit out of the action and pepper opponents with arrows is fun enough.).  I\\'ve played this through as both sword and bow, and both are very playable.\\nI can heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good old-fashioned RPG, but wants something with its tongue firmly wedged in its cheek.    Wonderful on both PC and android, it\\'s a great game for whiling away the hours.\\nThe voice acting of the wonderful Tony Jay will forever be missed.  His voice lives on in all the games and TV media he did.  You should play this, just to hear his wry humour and phenomenal voice.\\nThanks  InXile! You\\'ve made an old-fashioned RPGer very happy! Oldschool looking Adventure game. Typical stat picking in the beginning to either play a melee, summoner or buffing character. Plays a little bit stiff but makes up for it with good and funny voice actors. Lovely and funny game made with love, pick this up when on sale.\\nThe old DOS Bards Tales are included, but the game has nothing in common with them otherwise. One of the best set of games I have ever played, they are well done! They run well and smoothly, The controls are easy to master and its turn based combat. The world is huge, and i do mean huge. The story and quests are fun and well thought out, as you go on they do challange you. It is a must have for any avid rpg gamer. I give it a 10 out of 10. A lot of fun and wolves. The hell is this??\\n2/10 This was a fun tale. I especially liked the dialogues and how funny all the characters were, even those that seemed too serious.\\nTake your instruments out, it\\'s time to jam.\\n+) Good and funny story which also has just enough richness.\\n+) Easy mapping and puzzles.\\n-) Zoom in/out changes itself almost everytime.\\n-) The angle changing of maps makes the game play inconvenient.\\n-) It is hard to distinguish certain things from the map, such as chests. You have to open your eyes open, real wide, Haha. Heyyo, the comedy is solid, the gameplay is fun and the storyline is decent! I recommend this for anyone who\\'s a fan of Action/RPGs. It\\'s even ported to smartphones via iOS and Android for fun on the go... definitely check this out since it\\'s not an expensive game and it\\'ll give you hours of entertainment. The Bard\\'s Tale is a fairly linear ARPG with humor interspersed throughout the overall grind. Truthfully the game could have been cut in half level-wise and still retained all of its charm without all the unnecessary repetitive content (and boy does it get repetitive). Still forgivable in the grand scheme of things and a decent RPG in the end. The light-hearted python-esque mood really saves this game from a bad rating. This is one of my personal Best Games Never Played. It was even re-released on tablets, that says something for it. My full review is too long to post in this box, but boiling it down: A fun and funny self conscious parody aimed at anyone who’s familiar with RPGs, D&D, or the fantasy genre. If you want to laugh at yourself, this is a way to do it. this game is funny i like it alot I suppose I can recommend this one, though it\\'s not a particularly strong recommendation. It took me a while to get into the game, and I found this \"kill the bugbear\" sidequest at the very beginning basically impossible. However, soon afterwards you begin to acquire summons at a decent rate, and begin to specialize in a weapon type and take a few \"feats\" or \"perks\" to maximize your effectiveness (maybe increasing critical chance or giving a weapon an alternate attack). I did enjoy some of the humor (interacting with and understanding MacRath, a heavily-accented Scotsman, was the funniest part to me), and I was curious to see just which summons made the most effective counterpart to my playstyle and what lay around the next corner. However, it\\'s an old game, and it shows. The graphics and gameplay are both not ideal - the resolution seems a little too low (I was often shooting at offscreen enemies with my bow), and there was an odd chugging and slowdown in certain places in the game. The game also crashed three times for me, though I was able to progress on my second attempt through the area. However, I did feel compelled to play and finish. if you\\'d like to try something a little older and off the beaten path with more unique humor than most, give it a go. Great if you like 4th wall breaks, terrible humor, and a main character who thrives on snark. If you love to drink beer? Then you should defintly get this game and sing the beer song and summon a hot elf to be your companion. More text i can\\'t add, cause this says more then enough. i love this game one of mah first dongeon crawlers a loong time ago With an awesome ideia, this title manages to bring some original elements to RPGs. Adding importance to music attracts me so much that I got hooked from the very begining. Everything has a pinch of comedy behind, making many parts of the game funny, even though the background history is not that original.\\nThrough the game you\\'ll sure notice that usability has not been on focus, like save points badly positioned, movements too slow (not only walking, but atacking, defending, conjuring and so on), lack of explanation of some mechanics (not really a problem for many games, but the kind of info that is missing and the way the game exposes things to you doesn`t get along with this point), and other things.\\nIt should receive a positive recommendation, but there is one thing that hurts the game badly: too much useless scenarios. Too much walking that could be cut in half, too much useless \"do this\", \"do that\" and missions that doesn\\'t make sense. Beyond the acceptable. I could\\'ve spent half the time and still had the same fun.\\nSadly, this makes me want to give this game a negative recommendation. Still, I would recommend for RPG lovers.\\n6/10 This is a fun top down action rpg, in which you summon allies to help you (plays kind of like a variant of Diablo II, combat wise), though you play this game primarily for the humor, the songs and the fact you get the original Bard\\'s Tale trilogy with it. I tried playing it but it just couldnt grab me. The combat is fairly lackluster and the humor just isn\\'t really my cup of tea.\\nWhen its al said and done I just didnt have any drive to push through the combat and what I saw of the story to see if it gets any better later on. It might but Im not going to find out.\\nThe dated graphics dont bother me but if thats important for you keep that in mind. Goofy, plays like Baldur\\'s Gate: Dark Alliance. It\\'s fun.'"
